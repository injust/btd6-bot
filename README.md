# btd6-bot

A Python script that plays the Dark Castle map on Bloons TD 6. Farms Insta-Monkeys, Monkey Money, and XP!

Forked from [RavingSmurfGB/Py_AutoBloons](https://github.com/RavingSmurfGB/Py_AutoBloons) and inspired by [linus-jansson/btd6farmer](https://github.com/linus-jansson/btd6farmer).

## How it works

The script plays the Dark Castle map on Easy difficulty, collects any Collection Event items, and loops continously. It uses Obyn, a Monkey Sub, and a Ninja Monkey to beat the game.

## Usage

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Launch Bloons TD 6
3. Run `main.py`
4. Focus the Bloons TD 6 window within 5 seconds

## Supported resolutions
